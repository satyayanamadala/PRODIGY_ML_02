# ðŸ‘¥ Customer Segmentation - K-Means Clustering

This is **Task-02** for the **Machine Learning Internship** at **Prodigy Infotech**. The project demonstrates the use of **K-Means Clustering**, an unsupervised learning algorithm, to segment **retail customers** based on:

- Annual Income (`Annual Income (k$)`)
- Spending Score (`Spending Score (1-100)`)
- Age (`Age`)

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset

- **Source**: [Kaggle - Customer Segmentation](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vjchoudharyz/customer-segmentation-tutorial-in-python)
- File used: `Mall_Customers.csv`
- Features used: Age, Annual Income, Spending Score

---

## ðŸ”§ Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)
- Scikit-learn (K-Means Algorithm)
- Jupyter Notebook / Colab

## ðŸ§  ML Workflow

1. **Data Loading**
2. **Data Exploration & Visualization**
3. **Feature Scaling**
4. **Optimal Cluster Selection (Elbow Method)**
5. **K-Means Clustering**
6. **Cluster Visualization**

## ðŸ“ˆ Results

The model successfully identified distinct customer groups (e.g., high spenders, budget customers) that can be targeted using different marketing strategies. Visual clusters were plotted using 2D scatter plots.
